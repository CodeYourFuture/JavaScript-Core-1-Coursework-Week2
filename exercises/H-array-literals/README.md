If you ever find yourself writing code like this...

```js
let mentor1 = "Daniel";
let mentor2 = "Irina";
let mentor3 = "Rares";
```

...then it's probably time to use an **array**!

Arrays are data structures that hold a list of values.

```js
let mentors = ["Daniel", "Irina", "Rares"];
```

Arrays can hold any type of value (although almost always you only have one data type per array).

```js
let testScores = [16, 49, 85];
let grades = ["F", "D", "A"];
let greetings = ["Hello, how are you?", "Hi! Nice to meet you!"];
```
