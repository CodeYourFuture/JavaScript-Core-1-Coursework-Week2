/*
  You have to predict the output of this program WITHOUT EXECUTING IT.

  In order to do this, try writing down the value that all variables take
  during each step of the program execution.

  Answer the following questions:

  1. This program throws an error. Why? (If you can't find it, try executing it).
  2. Remove the line that throws the error.
  3. What is printed to the console?
  4. How many times is "f1" called?
  5. How many times is "f2" called?
  6. What value does the "a" parameter take in the first "f1" call?
  7. What is the value of the "a" outer variable when "f1" is called for the first time?
*/

// Answers

// the variable b is a local variable that defined inside the functions f1 and f2, so we can't print it outside these functions without defining the variable as public.
// the console will print the variables 2 and 6 firstly then it prints the loop of numbers start with 4,9,6,13,8
// f1 will be called 2 times
// f2 will be called 3 times
// the value of a parameter in the first "f1" call was 8
// the value of the "a" outer variable when "f1" was called for the first time was 6

let x = 2;
let a = 6;

const f1 = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

const f2 = function (a, b) {
  return a + b + x;
};

console.log(x);
console.log(a);

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  a = a + 1;
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    const d = f2(i, x);
    console.log(d);
  } else {
    const e = f1(i, a);
    console.log(e);
  }
}
