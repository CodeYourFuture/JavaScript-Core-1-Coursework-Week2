# Notes

- What did you find easy?
All the exercises in the "Exercises" folder.
- What did you find hard?
Nothing comes to my mind right now. Nothing seems to be too hard so far. It is all about practice right now.
- What do you still not understand?
I think I have understood most of the concepts we learned so far.
- Any other notes?
Even if my solutions are passing the tests, I always realise later, after doing some more research, that I could do the same thing in a much easier way using different JavaScript build-in methods. I definitely need more practice using these methods, in order to understand how they work and what they do.
